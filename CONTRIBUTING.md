# Contributing to Stash

This repository is designed as a personal knowledge base, but if you're collaborating or want to maintain consistency, here are some guidelines.

## Adding Content

### Ideas

- Create a new markdown file in the `ideas/` directory
- Use a descriptive filename (e.g., `mobile-app-concept.md`)
- Include status, date, and tags
- Update the idea file as the concept evolves

### Notes

- Add notes in the `notes/` directory
- Date your notes for context
- Use tags to make notes searchable
- Link to related notes or external resources

### Code Snippets

- Save snippets in the `code-snippets/` directory
- Organize by language (create subdirectories as needed)
- Include comments explaining the purpose and usage
- Add examples when helpful

### Resources

- Maintain curated lists in the `resources/` directory
- Group related resources together
- Include brief descriptions for each link
- Update the "Last Updated" date when making changes

## File Formats

- Prefer Markdown (.md) for text content
- Use appropriate extensions for code (.py, .js, .sh, etc.)
- Keep formatting consistent within each directory

## Organization

- Create subdirectories when a category grows large
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Maintain README files in each directory
- Remove or archive outdated content

## Best Practices

- **Be Descriptive**: Use meaningful titles and filenames
- **Add Context**: Include dates and background information
- **Tag Content**: Use tags to make searching easier
- **Link Related Items**: Connect related ideas and notes
- **Keep It Simple**: The goal is to capture ideas, not to over-engineer
